##IMDB Data
###Import Data
```{r import, include=FALSE}
library(readr)
IMDB_basic <- read_delim("https://datasets.imdbws.com/title.basics.tsv.gz", 
    "\t", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)

#Obtain only observations that are movies from 2014-2017
IMDB_basic_subset <- IMDB_basic %>%
  filter(titleType == "movie", startYear %in% (2014:2017)) %>%
  #Select only the columns I want
  select(1:3, 6, 9)
```

###Data Cleaning
####Clean up the genre column of IMDB data
```{r cleaning_IMDB, include=FALSE}
#To keep only the first genre listed in the genre column
IMDB_basic_subset$genres <- sapply(strsplit(IMDB_basic_subset$genres, ","), "[", 1)
```

##Box Office Mojo + Kraggle Data
###Clean Box Office Mojo Data
```{r cleaning_BOMojo, include=FALSE}
#Import Webscraped Box Office Mojo CSV
movies <- read.csv('Box Office Mojo CSV.csv',
                   stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
                   na.strings = c("","n/a", "NA"))

# this script cleans up box office revenue data in two major ways:

# 1) pulls a ton of empty rows and columns from the csv (~100k blank rows and 3 blank columns) to to make a less large and empty csv

better_data <- movies %>%
  filter(!is.na(Rank)) %>%
  rename(Domestic.Percent = Domestic..,
         Overseas.Percent = Overseas..) %>%
  select(1:10)

# 2) fixes units problem so that all dollar amounts are in the same unit (currently, dollars)
better_dollars <- better_data %>%
  # fix the units for worldwide
  separate(Worldwide.Dollar, c('sign', 'worldwide_box', 'unit'), c(1,-1)) %>% # break off the $ and k (or space)
  mutate(worldwide_box = as.numeric(stringr::str_remove(worldwide_box, ",")), # pull any commas from the dollar amount
         worldwide_box = ifelse(unit == "k", #multiply by 1,000 if it's k; by 1,000,000 if not
                                worldwide_box * 1000,
                                worldwide_box * 1000000)) %>%
  select(-sign, -unit) %>%
  
  # fix the units for domestic
  separate(Domestic.Dollar, c('sign', 'domestic_box', 'unit'), c(1,-1)) %>%
  mutate(domestic_box = as.numeric(stringr::str_remove(domestic_box, ",")),
         domestic_box = ifelse(unit == "k",
                                domestic_box * 1000,
                                domestic_box * 1000000)) %>%
  select(-sign, -unit) %>%
  
  # fix the units for overseas
  separate(Overseas.Dollar, c('sign', 'overseas_box', 'unit'), c(1,-1)) %>%
  mutate(overseas_box = as.numeric(stringr::str_remove(overseas_box, ",")),
         overseas_box = ifelse(unit == "k",
                               overseas_box * 1000,
                               overseas_box * 1000000)) %>%
  select(-sign, -unit)

# set columns per "How I Want Data to Look"
movies_clean <- select(better_dollars, Year, Title, Studio,
                       worldwide_box, domestic_box, overseas_box)

write.csv(movies_clean, file = "boxoffice.csv", quote = TRUE, row.names = FALSE, na = "0")
```

####Create International Release dummy variable based on films with N/A at either domestic or international box office
```{r international, include=FALSE}
BOMojo_data_clean <- movies_clean %>%
  mutate(International_Release = ifelse(is.na(overseas_box) | is.na(domestic_box), 1, 0))
```

####Recode Studio variable into a dummy var 
```{r studio, include=FALSE}
#list the distribution arms of major Hollywood studios for their inhouse-produced films
studio_distributors <- c("BV", "Uni.", "Sony", "WB", "WB (NL)", "Fox", "Par.")

#Recode Studio column using ifelse
BOMojo_data_clean$Studio <- ifelse(BOMojo_data_clean$Studio %in% studio_distributors, 1, 0)
```

####Create Production Budget variable
```{r budget, include=FALSE}
#Import The Numbers dataset that contains info on production budget and BOR (D and WW)
TheNumber_data <- read_csv("The Number Dataset.csv", 
    col_types = cols(`Domestic_Gross` = col_number(), 
        `P_Budget` = col_number(), 
        `Release_Date` = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%Y"), 
        `Worldwide_Gross` = col_number()))

#Subset out only the data that I want (2014-2017)
TheNumber_budget_2014_2017 <- TheNumber_data %>%
  #Remove the observations for which there is no box office data whatsoever
  filter(Domestic_Gross >= 300000) %>% 
  #select only the columns I want
  select(1:3, 5) %>%
  #Extract year from release date
  mutate(Year = year(Release_Date)) %>%
  #Filter in only observations released from 2014-2017
  filter(Year %in% (2014:2017))

#Convert movies titles to all lowercase to make the matching process easier
TheNumber_budget_2014_2017$Title <- tolower(TheNumber_budget_2014_2017$Title)

#Join with the BOMojo Data
BOMojo_expanded <- merge(BOMojo_data_clean, TheNumber_budget_2014_2017, by = c("Title", "Year"), all = TRUE)

#Import Kraggle movie dataset (only contains data up to the first half of 2017)
movies_metadata <- read_csv("movies_metadata.csv")

movies_metadata$release_date <- as.Date(movies_metadata$release_date)

kraggle_subset <- movies_metadata %>%
  #select only the columns of interest
  select(title, release_date, budget, popularity) %>%
  #filter in only films with release date from 2014-01-01 to 2017-12-31
  filter(release_date >= "2014-01-01", release_date <= "2017-12-31") %>%
  #select only observations with budget larger than 1
  filter(budget > 1) %>%
  ##Extract year from release date
  mutate(Year = year(release_date))


#Convert movies titles to all lowercase to make the matching process easier
kraggle_subset$title <- tolower(kraggle_subset$title)

#Match the observations from Kraggle onto those in the BOMojo dataframe
BOMojo_TheNumber_Kraggle <- merge(BOMojo_expanded, kraggle_subset, by.x = c("Title", "Year"), by.y = c("title", "Year"), all = TRUE)

#Select only Title, Year, P_Budget and budget from BOMojo_TheNumber_Kraggle
BOMojo_TheNumber_Kraggle_budget <- BOMojo_TheNumber_Kraggle %>%
  select(Title, Year, P_Budget, budget) %>%
  dplyr::rename("TheNumbers_Budget" = P_Budget, "Kraggle_Budget" = budget)

write.csv(BOMojo_TheNumber_Kraggle_budget, file = "BudgetData-TheNumbers-Kraggle.csv", quote = TRUE, row.names = FALSE)
```
#####Problem:
1) Some of the names are slightly different, even though the are referring to the same movies, so they won't join
2) There were some movies hat for some reasons was in the BOMojo datasets, even though they has a higher worldwide gross (mostly domestic-driven) than 300k 
3) The Numbers Production Budget data doesnt include that for foreign-produced films, so movies such as _The Mermaid_ and _Wolf Warriors 2_ which has a large WW box office gross driven mostly by the international box office. 

####Joining IMDB and Box Office Mojo Data
```{r join, include = FALSE}
#Convert movies titles to all lowercase to make the matching process easier
IMDB_basic_subset$primaryTitle <- tolower(IMDB_basic_subset$primaryTitle)
BOMojo_data_clean$Title <- tolower(BOMojo_data_clean$Title)

#Rename columns to match the naming convention of BOMojo dataset (for ease of merge)
IMDB_basic_subset <- IMDB_basic_subset %>% 
  rename("IMDB_ID" = tconst, "Title" = primaryTitle, "Year" = startYear) %>%
  select(-2)

##Attempt 1: before clustering
#Match the observations from IMDB onto those in the BOMojo dataframe; leave all nonmatch obs.
BOMojo_IMDB_1 <- merge(BOMojo_data_clean, IMDB_basic_subset, by = c("Title", "Year"), all = TRUE)

#Extract the nonmatch observations from BOMojo (most likely due to slight diff. in titles)
BOMojo_IMDB_small <- merge(BOMojo_data_clean, IMDB_basic_subset, by = c("Title"), all.x = TRUE, all.y = FALSE)

year_check <- BOMojo_IMDB_small %>%
  filter(Year.x > Year.y)
#Issue: some of these are due to different movies having the same names, but most are due to release date mismatches. 
#If different movies are improperly joined together because of their same names, there should be duplicate observations (multiple observations with the same title) because there are multiple distinct IMDB ID.
#I mannually went through and cross-referenced the BOMojo and IMDb pages of the duplicate observations, and identify which IMDB title is correct 


##Attempt 2 (after clustering): Merge BOMojo_IMDB_final1 with BOMojo_data_clean to attach IMDB_ID, genre as well as IMDB_Title to the main dataframe
BOMojo_IMDB_2 <- merge(BOMojo_data_clean, BOMojo_IMDB_final2, by = c("Title", "Year"), all = FALSE)

#Issue: 3 observations won't join even though they are in both r frames and has the same name; resort to manual fill-in
BOMojo_IMDB_2_fill_in <- read_csv("Manual BOMojo_IMDB_2 entries.csv")
BOMojo_IMDB_2_fill_in <- BOMojo_IMDB_2_fill_in %>%
  filter(!(is.na(IMDB_ID)))

#Add the manually filled-in observations back to BOMojo_IMDB_2
#Check: BOMojo_IMDB_2 and BOMojo_IMDB_final1 should have the same number of observations (1578)
BOMojo_IMDB_2 <- rbind(BOMojo_IMDB_2, BOMojo_IMDB_2_fill_in)
```

#install the requisite packages for working with API
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
library(xml2)
library(omdbapi)

#Create a string of IMBD IDs corresponding to the films in the Box Office Mojo dataset
IMDB_ID <- BOMojo_IMDB_2$IMDB_ID

#TEST
#Call to API for data on movie with IMDB ID 
OMDB_tt1843866 <- GET("http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=67ed49f9", query = list(i = "tt1843866", r = "json"))

json_text_content <- content(OMDB_tt1843866, as = "text") %>%
  fromJSON()
omdb_tt1843866 <- as.data.frame(json_text_content)
```
#####Note
Figure out how to systematically loop this process so you dont have to manually call every single movie in the box office mojo dataset
